When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When i'm stuck on a certain part of a project and can't figure out where to go from there I can use a remote
  repository on github and tell some of my friends to have a look at it so that maybe they think of things that
  I hadn't previously thought about.
